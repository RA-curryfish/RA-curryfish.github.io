For the things I learned in computer science. Security, operating systems, linux thingies(??), networks, hardware, it's all in this series of blogs. Since they are all related in some way, it is hard to seperate them out, but I'll try my best to talk about a specific topic. Writing these blogs would also test me, whether I'm able to explain it in a simple(?) way.
