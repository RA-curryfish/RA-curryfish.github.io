Which came first? The chicken or the egg? Well, it's the egg obviously. The parents of the first chicken were clearly _not_ chickens, and chickens definitely came from eggs. My favorite thing to do, apart from eating, is to train my muscles. This is a post about the things I learned related to muscle training, strength gain, nutrition and so on. 

Why muscles?
======
The process, to me, is therapeutic. I find that the results you get from this, is to a large extent, proportional to the amount of effort you put it. Humans really don't need a lot of muscle, but some is definitely beneficial. As we get older, the general belief is that we get weaker. But this is due to the fact that we don't focus on building strength and muscles, which actually helps us age gracefully. Below are three main factors that we _can_ mostly control to help us in this journey. Are there factors that we can't control? Yes. Genetics. The amount of muscle your body is able to put on, your sensitivity to creatine (although not a big factor), metabolism(?), your muscle insertions (if you're into those sorts of things), allergic reactions. Or you might be vegan and find it hard to consume enough protein without planning. But that doesn't mean we can't try. Make the most out of what we got. 

Training Hard

Your body actively resists to put on any more muscle than necessary, it just wants to ensure you are able to reproduce and keep the human race alive :) (with the population today, as if that's a challenge). So you must train pretty hard to force it to. And not only train, but get other factors like sleep and food right too. What does it mean to train hard? Lift heavy? More reps? More sets? Do you need to audibly grunt? It's often not so simple. It could be a combination of all or none.
