Which came first? The chicken or the egg? Well, it's the egg obviously. The parents of the first chicken were clearly _not_ a chicken, and chickens definitely came from eggs (I think lol). My favorite thing to do, apart from eating, is to train my muscles. This is a post about the things I learned related to muscle training, strength gain, nutrition and so on. 

Why muscles?
