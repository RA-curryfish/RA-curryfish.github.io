Virtual memory, fake it till you make it. Or rather, run it.

Virtual Memory
====
Many things in computer systems are solved by using a level of indirection. Virtual memory is one such thing. Rather than loading your application directly into the physical memory (RAM), a table (page table) of mapping between virtual memory addresses and physical addresses is created. OS needs to give the illusion that the entire RAM is available to the process, although it is shared by multiple processes and any of them can be run according to priorities. This table also stores whether the page is valid or not, because there might be another application that was context swtiched which could replace that physical memory location, thus invalidating it for the old process.
