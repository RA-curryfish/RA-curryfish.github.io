Random stuff. [Song that pairs well.](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=tl0jmpkniNk&list=RDAMVMtl0jmpkniNk)

You may notice a disconnect between posts and/or even within the same post. That's because, although a post is under the same date, it has been written at different points in time. They are not blogs, although it's original intent probably was. I thought I should indicate it somewhere as they don't seem coherent at all. At least everything related to the title should, then, fall under the same post.

The Process as Duty or Desires as a Goal
========================================
Seem familiar? The Bhagavad Gita iirc. Can you do this during, for example, an interview for a job? If instead of considering that having a job is an end goal, could you consider the process of learning during an interview a duty? Or in general, the process of learning as a duty? Would we then be satisfied no matter the outcome of the interview and probably many other things like exams? Probably not at all. Why? Because of the following reasons:
- Resources (like time, money, our lifespan) are limited 
- Too many people want too many 'comfortable' things. Struggling to learn concepts is not exactly comfortable. Shortsightedness is our trait. You would eat sugar before eating (drinking?) oil
- People probably cannot afford to enjoy the process in today's world, because if they do, then someone else might 'progress' further (exceptions certainly exist, but again, not the norm)
