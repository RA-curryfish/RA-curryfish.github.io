Today, we look at operating systems in general. Their purpose and role.

Operating Systems
======
They dictate how software and applications can interact with the hardware. Some are minimilistic, some are complex. They are present to make sure the users and the developers don't worry about intricacies involved in how to make use of the hardware. They ensure you get accesses to resources you requested, if you have the right permissions. There are many programs to be run, but resources are limited. The OS gives an illusion that each program owns the resource it uses. There are some 'microkernels' that allow you to use hardware to suit your needs rather than following a fixed mechanism. You may choose the mechanism for a particular policy, for example, for scheduling threads in your program you can use FCFS. While I can use round robin for my program and so on. This also greatly improves security as they isolate components to a great degree, thereby minimizing faults to a single domain. However, for efficiency reasons, most OSes today don't allow you to operate this way. They have a predetermined mechanism for every policy.
