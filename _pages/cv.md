* Concepts: Software Engineering, Computer Security, Systems, Databases, Networks, Assembly, Computer Architecture, Game Development

Work experience
======
* Microsoft, Software Engineer (Jul '22 - Aug '23)
  * Assisted in developing a real-time network fault monitoring solution from scratch for all of Microsoft's corporate devices
  * Developed the stream analytics engine to ingest, process and enrich telemetry data in about 1 minute, end to end
  * Built an SNMP trap solution to collect, filter, and process around 100k traps per minute using containers and Windows services
  * Created comprehensive documentation, including architecture and SLAs for all team projects to facilitate easy onboarding
  * Implemented design patterns & optimizations, like caching, reducing network load & data delay from minutes to seconds

* Nutanix: Software Engineer Intern (Jan '22 - Jun '22)
  * Facilitated migration of around 800 regression tests to a new test automation framework to move away from manual testing
  * Enabled dynamic deployment, pairing & configuration of virtual network resources like load balancers & network controllers
  * Reduced the test set up time from a couple of hours to around 10 minutes and eliminated the chance of configuration errors

* Microsoft: Software Engineer Intern (May '21 - Jul '21)
  * Built a comprehensive gallery of UI components, enabling developers to accelerate and simplify web development
  * Provided a unified experience across teams and prevented redundant development work through the component library
  * Exposed various component parameters, allowing developers to tailor the appearance and behavior to their specific needs
  * Embedded code along with accessibility and unit tests to ensure compliance with standards and best practices

Projects & Research
======
* Compartment Interface Vulnerabilities (WIP)
  * Investigating vulnerabilities that may occur after program partitioning using static analyses like program dependence graph
  * Assisting in implementing automatic fine-grained policy enforcements for applications utilizing untrusted libraries
* PongOS (WIP)
  * Built a kernel from scratch on x86 architecture using assembly and freestanding C to make and play the game Pong 
  * Implemented paging, interrupt handling
* Thread Synchronization with Path Expressions
  * Parsed input expressions, containing functions and operations, into a sequence of permissible thread execution paths
  * Emphasizes application synchronization requirements, abstracting away implementation details of semaphores, signals, etc.
* SSH
  * Implemented SSH - symmetric key exchange using RSA, data encryption and decryption using OpenSSL library functions
  * Introduced a man-in-the-middle malicious server to snoop on and manipulate the data being exchanged
* Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities
  * Exploited programs to inject code into the address space and disrupt control statements
  * Changed code flow by manipulating function pointers by overflowing the heap and using libc calls
  * Bypassed non-executable stack through Return Oriented Programming to gain root shell access

Certifications & Extra-Curriculars
======
* Introduction to Game Development
* Neural Networks and Deep Learning
* Give Campaign Part of of Microsoftâ€™s CSR, involved in donations and volunteering to the needy and nonprofits
