I'm Rahul Shevade, a computer science grad student at The Pennsylvania State University. I did my undergrad in computer science at BITS Pilani, India, where I interned at Microsoft and Nutanix. I then worked at Microsoft as a software engineer for a year before pursuing my graduate studies. My interests lie in the areas of security, systems and networks. I'm part of the Security of Software group at Penn State, where I'm working on privilege separation and policy enforcement. I'm fuelled by coffee and I hope to make computer systems much safer than they are today :)
