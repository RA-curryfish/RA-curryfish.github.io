I'm Rahul Shevade, a computer science grad student at The Pennsylvania State University. I did my bachelor's in computer science, with a master's in Economics at BITS Pilani, India. I got the opportunity to intern at Microsoft and Nutanix after which I worked at Microsoft as a software engineer for a year before pursuing my graduate studies. My interests lie in the areas of security, systems and networks. I'm part of the Security of Software group at Penn State, where I'm working on privilege separation, policy enforcement, and other cool stuff. I'm fuelled by coffee and I hope to make computer systems much safer than they are today :)

In my free time, I'm probably geeking out on things about:
- the universe
- archaeology, history and civilizations
- security exploits and malware
- survival techniques, camping, forests
- video games
- whatever YouTube manages to get me interested into that particular day
