I'm Rahul Shevade, a Computer Science grad student at The Pennsylvania State University. My interests lie in the areas of security, systems and networks. I work as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Security of Software group at Penn State, where I'm working on various things like probabilistic programs, fuzzing, privilege separation, automatic policy enforcement, and other cool stuff. I did my bachelor's in Computer Science, with a master's in Economics at BITS Pilani, India. I got the opportunity to intern at Microsoft and Nutanix, after which I worked at Microsoft as a software engineer for a year before pursuing my graduate studies. I'm fuelled by coffee and I hope to make computer systems much safer than they are today :)

In my free time, I'm probably geeking out on things about:
- the universe, physics, cosmology (I don't understand any of it :D)
- archaeology, history, civilizations, religious lore
- security exploits and malware
- survival techniques, camping, forests
- video games
- whatever YouTube manages to get me interested into that particular day
